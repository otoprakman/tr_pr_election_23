# Data Analysis for 2023 Turkish Presidential Elections

## Introduction

Presidential elections were held in Turkey in May 2023, alongside parliamentary elections, to elect a president for a term of five years. It marks the first time a Turkish presidential election has gone to a run-off.

In the first round, Erdogan and Ogan outperformed expectations to receive 49.5% and 5.2% of the vote respectively. Meanwhile, Kilicdaroglu won 44.9%, while Muharrem Ince (who remained on the ballot despite withdrawing) received 0.4%. Since Erdogan's vote share was 0.5% short of winning outright, he and Kilicdaroglu contested a run-off vote on 28 May. Erdogan was re-elected in the second round with 52.18% of the vote to 47.82% for Kilicdaroglu.

Election results were disappointment for Kilicdaroglu supporters and Erdogan has all the advantage going into the second round after winning 49.5 percent of votes in the first round. 5 percent of the vote was garnered by Ogan who is a nationalist and at the runoff it was crucial for both leaders Erdogan and especially for Kilicdaroglu. However, there was another tackle for Kilicdaroglu, Kurdish votes who supported Kilicdaroglu in the first round. Kilicdaroglu had to seek the balance of nationalist statements and the level of his tone. He chose nationalist one. How did it affect the second round, let's have a look.

I'll provide some questions and answers by providing some graphs and analysis.

## Testing the call of KK to his supporters to vote.

After the first round Kilicdaroglu asked for voters to vote, how is that request responded by voters?

**Question-1:** *Is there a significant turnout rate difference in cities where KK get the most of the vote in the first round?*

![rte_vs_kk](https://github.com/otoprakman/tr_pr_election_23/assets/53580699/ffefda28-db36-415e-8b7e-39ffa4e774cc)

There are 30 cities where KK was leading in the first round and 51 cities where RTE was leading. Here in the plot we compare percentage of turnout changes where candidates were leading in the first round. According to the plot it's clear that turnout rate negatively changed overall, however, cities at where KK was leading in the first round didn't respond well his call for voting.

**Question-2:** *How candidates votes changed in percentage between consecutive rounds?*

*(KK-RTE difference of percentage difference between rounds in ascending order-RTE votes increased more than KK)*

*(KK-RTE difference of percentage difference between rounds in descending order-KK votes increased more than RTE)*

![count_diff](https://github.com/otoprakman/tr_pr_election_23/assets/53580699/9b2021df-000a-4b5a-8da7-ea2428ae339d)

RTE increased his votes at all cities except Batman (-%1.19). Suprisingly, RTE increased his votes in Igdir (+%20). KK votes are decreased in some cities especially most in Agri and increased most in Kayseri.

**Question-3:** *How KK nationalist speeches after first round responded by voters, was he able to attract Sinan Ogan(SO) voters?*

![so_diff](https://github.com/otoprakman/tr_pr_election_23/assets/53580699/a2a9b793-6d07-4df7-84a2-66ebd6384e4f)

Pearson Correlation Coefficient between KK Diff and SO pct (without Igdir): 0.8306001040759013

High correlation indicates KK was successful at getting SO's votes better than RTE in overall. Igdir is an exception, it's the city where RTE increased his votes %20

**Closer Look At Nationalist Cities**

Let's check parliament election results first. We label cities where total nationalist parties (IYIP and MHP) votes are above %25.

![nat_so_diff](https://github.com/otoprakman/tr_pr_election_23/assets/53580699/0786c31a-fa18-4103-b25d-aeb7e6fdb11b)

Pearson Correlation Coefficient between KK Diff and SO pct: 0.407891970708202

KK increased his vote in all nationalist cities. It seems nationalist speech was helpful gaining attention of SO votes

**How about Kurdish votes?**

We label cities where YSP(Yesiller Sol Parti) votes are above %25.

![ysp_so_diff](https://github.com/otoprakman/tr_pr_election_23/assets/53580699/7ec222ec-ac86-4358-9fdc-40884ad8cc2b)

Pearson Correlation Coeffcient between KK Diff and SO pct: 0.0073420806258775295

RTE performed better than KK in all YSP-leaning cities regardless of SO vote rates. Overall it indicates voters who preferred SO in first round over KK voted KK in second round. 

## Conclusion

Overall, we wanted to have an opinion about whether Kilicdaroglu's strategy after first round was successful or not.
